      "Exiles 9s Captains Debrief - JK",
      "First off I would like to take note of how far the Exiles have come in such a short space of time from a conversation over beers between Myself, Zak, Oli and Charlie on how we can shake up rugby league for Germany in increasing its exposure and growth whilst providing a pathway and opportunity for both British based and Germany based players. I'd like to give a special mention to our chairman Zak James in helping with our direction and the rest of our committee with Ad Morley, Oliver Bowie, Connor Hampson Personal Trainer, Iain Bowie and Beki Gemmell who all have been instrumental in getting us to where we are today.",
      "Another special mention to 9s sponsor Marcél Schlicht who has been a huge support of Rugby League Deutshcland but was also a big supporter of the Exiles in the run up to and on the day at Rotterdam travelling from Switzerland to support us! We thank you massively Marcél and look forward to your continued support for Nationaler Rugby League Deutschland e.V moving forward",
      "Rotterdam poised a perfect opportunity to kick start what I feel is going to be new era for the NRLD and rugby league in Germany as a whole with players coming from both Germany and UK into the Exiles to showcase the talent and show that the Germans are here in Europe and to set a marker.",
      "Arriving the boys were ready and with some run throughs that was graced with the presence of the president of the NRLD Bob Doughton and his lovely family on their trip through to the UK the boys looked good and although most hadn't played together or at least not for a long time they looked in a good shape and ready to go",
      "First game up was against Nederlandse Rugby League Bond Combined. Unfortunately some dropouts for the Dutch meant they had to borrow players from the attending teams so it was a combined team from different nations with Aussie and British players bolstering their ranks to make it a competitive day. This wasn't an easy game and the nerves definitely showed! With hard hits coming in from both teams it was a tough test with the experienced players really showing their worth. The NRLB ran us close but the Exiles showed their grit and some fantastic plays from Zak Bredin and masterclass kicking from Josh McConnell meant we came out the first game 12-10 the better",
      "Next up was against experienced side Robertson SPUDDIES, previous winners of the cup and flying in from Australia. First half was hard hitting with solid runs from Henning Brockmann, Ad Morley, Josh McConnell and Korbi Mayer taking us into half time 10-10. The Aussies realised the Germans were here to play and the second half they definitely showed their experience coming out strong scoring 2 tries to our 1 in the second half to take the spoils 22-14 making it a close but entertaining game. Even the Spuddies came off stating how hard and physical the game was.",
      "After a long break for lunch the break in play really showed when coming up against Cockermouth Titans Rugby League with a tough team in front us the first half again was a tight affair with nothing in it to separate the teams with hard work in defence needed with Zach Burke, Fabian Wendt and Harry Cartwright putting some big hits in and some great running from Karsten, Aaron and Frede to put us close in the first half. Unfortunately it wasn't to be and Cockermouth showed their experience of playing together and ran out winner with it being 3 tries to 2 to Cockermouth showing how close we were to the top 2 teams!",
      "Last game up was last years winners Eastern Rhinos Rugby League Club. Knowing this was going to be 3/4th place playoff regardless we decided to play it as such in the groups to get the day wrapped up. After a big talk the boys were raring to go even after a short turn around having only 10 minutes rest after the hard fought previous game and wanted to put right some the wrongs and that they did. The hits came in strong from rhinos and they really fronted up and showed they'd also learned and adapted through the tournament but the defence was strong by the exiles with strong running from Josh McConnell using Rhinos as bowling pins running in tries from 20/30 meters took us into halftime up. We knew we need to hold them out and we came out all guns blazing leaving everything on the field! As such a more comfortable win of 20-10 to take the bronze medal",
      "It showed where we are and showed the German rugby is a force that is coming to the rugby league world!",
      "Special thanks to all the players for leaving it all out on the field and putting well established teams to the wire. When we look at it losing 4 tries to 3 against Spuddies and 3-2 to Cockermouth it shows how close we are to the established teams!",
      "Thanks to our travelling support with Fee, Vanessa, Amelia travelling from UK and Charlie coming across from Germany it was great to have you cheering us on!",
      "Huge mention to Malte Rohrmoser who unfortunately couldn't play due to late injury but still came across and provided amazing media support!!",
      "And our kit supplier Pronto Teamwear who without wouldn't have us looking so good!",
      "Big thanks to Rotterdam Pitbulls RLFC for an amazing tournament and hospitality! We look forward to the return and thanks to Contact Door Sport who without them the tournament would be that much harder for the Pitbulls organising team",
      "And a thanks to our followers and support! We cannot believe how much support we have from the various countries! As captain of the 9s team it's humbling to see the words of support for the lads and team!"
